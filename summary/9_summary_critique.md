### Analysis of Compressed Version Against Original Article

Below is a thorough examination of discrepancies between the compressed version and the original article, along with the necessary corrections.

---

### 1. Title and Introduction
#### Original:
- Title: "AI_devs 3, Lekcja 1, Moduł 1 — Interakcja z dużym modelem językowym"
- Introduction mentions various aspects of generative AI and emphasizes both design and programming perspectives.

#### Compressed:
- The title has not been altered.
- The introduction fundamentally changes the tone, slightly rephrasing the merger of programming and graphics creation.

**Discrepancy**: The phrase "dotychczas nie były bezpośrednio związane z programowaniem" does not directly match the original context regarding how graphic design was previously viewed compared to programming.

**Correction**: Maintain the original emphasis on the evolving relationship without altering the phrasing.

### 2. Section Headings
#### Original:
- Subsections under “1. Wprowadzenie do tematu” include more elaboration without stated subheadings in the compressed version.

#### Compressed:
- Compressed version uses headings like "1.1 Picthing" and "1.2 Projekty Pieter Levels", which is a deviation from the original structure.

**Discrepancy**: It changes the subsection structure without clear demarcation.

**Correction**: Maintain the original context and structure, offering complete phrases and contexts without assuming logical renaming.

### 3. Detailed Content Summary
#### 3.1 Picthing
- Original provided context about improvements and highlights its practical utility.

#### Compressed:
- The description adequately covers the utility, but lacks details about background and creator verification.

**Discrepancy**: Missing mention of how the generative AI significantly improves background removal quality.

**Correction**: Include "znacznym wzroście jakości", showcasing the original's depth.

### 4. Pieter Levels Projects
#### Original:
Detailed explanations of the significance of each of Pieter Levels' projects.

#### Compressed:
- Adequately lists projects but lacks depth regarding the implications of the statistics shared.

**Discrepancy**: The compressed version elides the importance of the statistics emphasized in the original.

**Correction**: Add: "i są skuteczne, co potwierdzają statystyki przedstawiane przez Pietera."

### 5. Image Presentation
#### Original:
Includes images with specific descriptions that relate directly to their contents.

#### Compressed:
Images are present but lack detailed accompanying context or discussion that informs the reader about their relevance more thoroughly.

**Discrepancy**: Compressed version lacks essential contextual framing of images which diminishes understanding.

**Correction**: Introduce proper sentences to frame images, explaining the relevance as observed in the original.

### 6. Current Image Generation Capabilities
#### 6.1 Development
- Original provided a nuanced look at advances from 2022 to 2024 and set the stage for discussing capabilities in graphic generation. 

#### Compressed:
Summarizes the advancements but fails to reflect specific qualitative assessments regarding image generation technologies.

**Discrepancy**: Implicit conclusions in the compressed version don’t emphasize qualitative metrics present in original discourse.

**Correction**: Accurately reflect ranges of improvements and limitations regarding the models’ functionality.

### 7. Limitations Section
#### Original:
Explicitly discusses ongoing difficulties in generating complex image details.

#### Compressed:
It mentions limitations but lacks the structured nuanced approach observed in the original.

**Discrepancy**: The detail about expectations compared to technological capabilities is distinctly absent.

**Correction**: Maintain the original tone discussing the expectations versus capabilities in-depth.

### 8. Prompts for Models
#### Original:
Focused on succinct prompt design, including examples.

#### Compressed:
Condensed prompt techniques but missed the subtle advice about experimenting with prompts.

**Discrepancy**: An essential aspect of using varied approaches to prompts, which is valuable for the reader.

**Correction**: Reinforce the experimental tone with "Eksperymentowanie z różnymi podejściami do promptów…"

### 9. HTML & CSS Integration 
#### Original:
Illustrated the capabilities with HTMLCSStoImage in detail and practical application examples.

#### Compressed:
Mentioned but without the full depth of integration possibilities explained.

**Discrepancy**: Compression lacks in conveying the significance of this technology in broader application scopes.

**Correction**: Emphasize how HTML and CSS can advance integration with generative features.

### 10. Final Remarks
#### Original:
Includes a strong concluding call to action for understanding the tools for the reader’s benefit.

#### Compressed:
Condensed conclusion present but loses motivational phrasing from the original.

**Discrepancy**: The emphasis on knowing necessary tools for leveraging advantages in the field is watered down.

**Correction**: Reinstate the encouragement presented in the conclusion of the original.

### 11. Missing Content
The compressed version lacks:
- Mention of specific conceptual ties between AI models and user interactions.
- Explicit encouragement to view mid-level prompts as facilitating effective generation.
- Details surrounding generative AI's potential beyond mere image generation, into broader digital content creation.

### 12. Unauthorized Additions 
There are no unauthorized additions noted beyond structural and condensing transformations. All presented content is sourced or summarized.

### Summary of Corrections Needed
1. Adjust phrasing in the title and introduction to retain context.
2. Ensure each subsection maintains rich content density as in the original.
3. Include specifics about tools and projects to maintain critical context.
4. Refrain from simplifying nuanced discussions about limitations and developments.
5. Provide full image context, ensuring readers glean insights from graphical references.
6. Stress experimental usage suggestions for prompt generation.
7. Maintain last section's motivational tone for reader engagement.

### Conclusion
The compression process sacrificed essential details and context necessary for full comprehension. Detailed adjustments to restore phrasing accuracy, depth, and contextual relevance are required for the compressed article to align perfectly with the original.
